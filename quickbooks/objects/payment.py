    QBO definition: A Payment entity records a payment in QuickBooks. The payment can be
    applied for a particular customer against multiple Invoices and Credit Memos. It can also
    be created without any Invoice or Credit Memo, by just specifying an amount.

        - A Payment can be updated as a full update or a sparse update.
        - A Payment can be linked to multiple Invoices and Credit Memos
        - A Payment can be created as unapplied to any Invoice or Credit Memo, in which case
            it is recorded as a credit.
        - If any element in any line needs to be updated, all the Lines of a Payment have to be
            provided. This is true for full or sparse update. Lines can be updated only ALL or NONE.
        - To remove all lines, send an empty Lines tag.
        - To remove some of the lines, send all the Lines that need to be present MINUS the
            lines that need to be removed.
        - To add some lines, send all existing and new Lines that need to be present.
        - The sequence in which the Lines are received is the sequence in which lines are preserved.
